# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# We want control over statuses, so they are not editable from the application and only through the seeds
# and/or migrations.  We replicate the values for these statuses in the Status model, so any changes here
# should be reflected there as well.
